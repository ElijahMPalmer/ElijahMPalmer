## Hi there! I'm Elijah! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Software Engineer with experience ranging from Web App Development (PERN Stack) to Embedded Systems (Arduino/ Raspberry Pi) with some dabbling in Java.

I enjoy making anything that comes to mind, come to life. I have 5 years of experience with computer aided drafting, 3D printing, and reverse engineering using SolidWorks and Fusion 360.

I have 4 years of honorable military service in the U.S. Marine Corps as a maintenance supervisor, additive manufacturing instructor, and diesel technician. As a military veteran, I have learned to thrive in high stress and high tempo environments, which allows me to continually adapt, overcome, and develop the solution the client is looking for quickly.
