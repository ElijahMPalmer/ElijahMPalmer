## Hi there! I'm Elijah! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Software Engineer with experience ranging from Web App Development (PERN Stack) to Embedded Systems (Arduino/ Raspberry Pi) with some dabbling in Java.

I enjoy making anything that comes to mind, come to life. I have 5 years of experience with computer aided drafting, 3D printing, and reverse engineering using SolidWorks and Fusion 360.

I have 4 years of honorable military service in the U.S. Marine Corps as a maintenance supervisor, additive manufacturing instructor, and diesel technician. As a military veteran, I have learned to thrive in high stress and high tempo environments, which allows me to continually adapt, overcome, and develop the solution the client is looking for quickly.

## What am I working on? ðŸ”¨
- Car-Wiz
    - A resource hub for car owners to find resources for maintenance on their vehicles easily.
    - [Live Site](http://car-wiz.surge.sh/)
    - [Repo](https://github.com/ElijahMPalmer/Car-Wiz)
    - Core Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM API, FullPageJS FrameWork, JQuery, and 3rd Party API to parse data.
    - A user can type in their vehicle's VIN and find basic details about the vehicle, such as engine type and horsepower. It also provides the user with links to Owners Manuals and Maintenance Forums specific to their make of vehicle.
    - My plan for this project is also to be an online vehicle logbook for users to track their maintenance tasks and be reminded when certain maintenance intervals are coming soon.
- Sun-Kissed Jewelry Landing Page
    - This project is still in the planning and discovery phase!
    - More to come soon! ðŸ‘€
